Video tutorial : https://youtu.be/JMV4OvBJEE0

This project of mine is more of a learning curve to understand the difference between the PIR and microwave motion sensor available in the market.

Then we will connect them to an ESP32 and a LoRa module to make a wireless motion detection system wherein once motion is detected the message is transferred through LoRa and is read by the ESP32 receiver which switches a LED remotely when motion is detected.

At the end of the tutorial, we will be able to use the sensors standalone and with micros like esp8266/esp32 etc.
